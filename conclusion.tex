\section{Related Work and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

There has been much work on assembly or
machine code verification. Most of them
do not support function calls or simply
treat function calls in the continuation-passing
style where return addresses are viewed as first
class code pointers~\cite{PCC,FPCC,TAL,TALx86,Yu03ESOP,xcap,cflogic}.
SCAP~\cite{Feng06pldi} supports assembly code verification
with various stack-based control abstractions, including
function call and return. We follow the same idea here.
However, SCAP gives a syntactic-based soundness proof
by establishing the preservation of the syntactic judgment,
which makes it difficult to interact with other modules
verified in different logic. Since our goal is to
verify inline assembly and link the verified code
with the verified C programs, we give a direct-style
semantic model of the logic judgments. And it allows us
to extend our program logic to support verifying
contextual refinement without much challenges.
Also SCAP
is based on a simplified subset of assembly instructions,
while our work is focused on a realistically modeled
subset of \sparc{} instructions.

In terms of the support of realistic instruction sets,
previous work on proof-carrying code (PCC) and
typed assembly language (TAL) mostly supports subsets of
x86.
Myreen's work \cite{arm-veri} presents a framework for
ARM verification based on a realistic model
(but it doesn't support function call and return).

As part of the Foundational Proof-Carrying Code (FPCC)
project~\cite{FPCC},
Tan and Appel present a program logic $\mathcal{L}_c$
for reasoning about control flow in assembly code~\cite{cflogic}.
Although $\mathcal{L}_c$ is implemented
on top of the SPARC machine language,
the underlying logic is a type system instead
of a full-blown program logic for functional correctness.
It reasons about functions in the continuation-passing
style. Also
handling SPARC features such as delayed writes or delayed
control transfers is not the focus of $\mathcal{L}_c$.
%They also reason about functions in the continuation-passing
%style.
There has been work on mechanized semantics of the SPARCv8 ISA.
%Here are already some works for SPARCv8 ISA formalization.
\etal{Hou}~\cite{sparcv8-formalization-Isabelle} model the SPARCv8 ISA
in Isabelle/HOL, and test their formal model against
LENON3 simulation board,
which is a synthesisable VHDL model of a 32-bit processor
compliant with the SPARCv8 architecture,
through more than 100,000 instruction instances.
\etal{Wang}~\cite{sparc-formalization} formalize its semantics in Coq.
%However, both of their works give no program logic.
Our operational semantics of SPARCv8 follows \etal{Wang}~\cite{sparc-formalization}.
%\etal{Wang}~\cite{sparc-formalization}
%formalize the SPARCv8 ISA in Coq but give
%no program logic. Our operational
%semantics of SPARCv8 follows their work.
Since neither \etal{Wang} nor we validate the
formalization against actual hardware, this remains
as future work.

% But \etal{Wang} do not validate their formalization against actual
% hardware, we remain it as a future work.

\etal{Ni}~\cite{ctxm} verify a context switch module of 19 lines
in x86 code to showcase the support of embedded
code pointers (ECP) in XCAP~\cite{xcap}.
We use our program logic to verify the contextual
refinement between a context switch routine in \sparc{}
and $\primsw{}$ primitive. The context switch routine
implemented in \sparc{} that we verified
is more complicated then
implemented in x86, because of the requirement to save
the contexts stored in register window in memory.
% The context switch
% module we verify comes from a practical OS kernel,
% which is more realistic and consists of more than 250 lines
% of assembly code, but our logic (\textbf{CALL} rule)
% does not really support the switch of return pointers,
% which requires further extension like OCAP~\cite{FengTLDI07}.
% Our focus is to verify the
% code manages the register windows, and the function calls made internally.
% We address this problem of calling context switch routine in
% another way in our work, such that we can use the extended
% program logic to verify the contextual refinement between
% context switch routine and $\primsw{}$ primitive.
% The method of verifying context switch primitive in our work is
% inspired by the approach used by \etal{Guo}~\cite{ctxmGuo}
% that protects the TCBs through abstraction, but the state
% relation between low- and high-level program state in our work is more
% sophisticated than theirs, because of some specific mechanisms,
% like register windows, in SPARCv8.
% They also do not develop a general program
% logic for refinement verification of the assembly.
% Our extended program logic is based on the relational program logic,
% which has already been well used
% successfully in the refinement verification
% of C-style language \cite{Xu16cav,liang13pldi,liang14lics}.

Yang and Hawblitzel~\cite{YangPLDI10} verify Verve, an x86
implementation of an experimental operating system. Verve has two
levels, the high-level TAL code and the low-level ``Nucleus''
that provides primitive access to hardware and memory.
The Nucleus code is verified automatically using the Z3 SMT solver,
while the goal of our work is to generate machine checkable proofs.
Another key difference is the use of different ISAs. Here
we give details to verify specific features of SPARCv8 programs.

There have been many techniques and tools proposed for automated
program verification (\eg~\cite{SymbolicExecutionSpLogic,Smallfoot}).
It is possible to adapt them to verify SPARCv8 code.
We propose a new program logic and do the verification in Coq mainly
because the work is part of a big project for a fully certified OS
kernel for aerospace crafts whose inline assembly is written in
SPARCv8. We already have a program logic implemented in Coq for
C programs, which allows us to verify C code with Coq proofs.
Therefore we want to have a program logic for SPARCv8 so that
it can be linked with the correctness proof of
C and can generate machine-checkable Coq proofs too.
That said, many of the automated verification techniques can
be applied to reduce the manual efforts to write Coq proofs,
which we would like to study in the future work.
% We have already shown that it's possible to apply some
% Coq tactics based on separation logic \cite{practical-tactics}
% in our work.


% %Most of our code verification works are done by hand now.
% %\etal{Berdine}~\cite{SymbolicExecutionSpLogic}\cite{Smallfoot} describe a
% %method for proving Hoare triples by a form of symbolic execution,
% %in order to achieve automatical reasoning. Their symbolic execution algorithm
% %works by proof-search using operational and rearrangement rules.
% %%Our current work consider less about automatical reasoning,
% %%but it's possible to do much effort on it in the future.
% %The operational rules in Berdine's work are similar with
% %traditional Hoare logic rules with some certain restrictions on pre- and post-condition,
% %and their rearrangement rules can be viewed as some derived rules from the basic ones.
% %So, in order to use their algorithm to achieve automatic reasoning of SPARCv8 code,
% %we have to design a Hoare-style program logic for SPARCv8 code firstly,
% %which is the aim of our work.
% %%With a Hoare-style program logic for SPARCv8 code,
% %%their algorithm can be implemented as a Coq tactic.
% %Although, our current work consider less about automatical reasoning,
% %it's possible to extend it and their algorithm can be implemented as a Coq tactic
% %based on our Hoare-style program logic for SPARCv8 code in the future.

% %There are many impressive pioneering works
% %that focus on machine code verification.
% %Projects on proof-carrying code (PCC) \cite{PCC, FPCC}
% %and typed assembly language (TAL) \cite{TAL, TALx86}

% %They aim to find a method to address safety properties
% %of assembly code by automatic type-checking.
% %Generating proofs automatically is difficult in many times.
% %So, the work \cite{Yu03ESOP} of \etal{Yu} provides the CAP framework
% %to support a Hoare-logic style reasoning for assembly code.
% %However, works on PCC, TAL and CAP only focus on

\paragraph{\textbf{Conclusion.}}
We present a relational program logic for \sparc.
Our logic is based on a realistic semantics
model and supports the main features of \sparc,
including delayed control transfer, delayed writes,
and register windows.
It also supports modular reasoning of
function call in a direct-style and
refinement verification.
We apply our logic to verify
that there is a contextual refinement between
a context switch routine implementated
in \sparc{} and $\primsw$ primitive for task switching.
% And we also extend the program logic to support
% refinement verification and apply the extended
% program logic to verify
% that there is a contextual refinement between
% a context switch routine implementated
% in \sparc{} and $\primsw$ primitive for task switching.
% We have applied the program logic to verify
% the main body of the context switch routine
% in a realistic embedded OS kernel.
% And we also extend the program logic to support
% refinement verification.
Our current work can only handle
sequential \sparc{} program verification and
do not consider interrupt in machine model.
We will extend it for concurrency verification
and finish the step {\color{blue} \textcircled{1}} shown in
\Fig{\ref{fig:idea to establish contextual refinement}}
that the compilation can ensure the behaviors
of the Pseudo-SPARCv8 code calling abstraction assembly
primitives in intermediate level refines
the behaviors of
the client C code calling abstract assembly primitives
in source level in the future.
% %and accurate models of \sparc{} program,
% %and supports module, local, function call/return
% %and main features of \sparc{} verification.
% %We also give a semantic approach for soundness establishing
% %and prove the soundness of our logic.
% %We finally apply it to verify a context switch module
% %which has been used in an actual embedded OS kernel.
% % Our current work can only handle
% % sequential \sparc{} program verification for partial correctness.
% % We will extend it for concurrency
% % and refinement verification in the future. Also
% % we would like to link the verified inline assembly
% % with verified C code for whole system
% % verification.
{\color{blue}
We will also consider to automate the reasoning
for certain parts with automatic provers like Z3~\cite{Z3}
or integration with framework like Frama-C~\cite{framac}, to
reduce the required human effort in the verification work
in the future.
