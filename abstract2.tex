Inline assembly code is common in system software to interact with
the underlying hardware platforms. Safety and correctness of the
assembly code is crucial to guarantee the safety of the whole
system. In this paper we propose a practical Hoare-style program
logic for verifying SPARC assembly code. The logic supports
modular reasoning about the main features of SPARCv8 ISA, including
delayed control transfers, delayed writes to special registers,
and register windows. We have applied it
to verify the main body of a context switch routine in a realistic 
embedded OS kernel, and extended it to support 
contextual refinement verification.
All of the formalization and proofs have been mechanized in Coq.
